This theme is based on the default [Jacaranda] MustardOS theme with some minor modifications. I removed shadows and gradients from the theme and applied popular color presets.
Changes regarding the main theme [Jacaranda] MustardOS:
New color schemes (alternate)
Minor edits to global.ini
Replaced sounds (back.wav, confirm.wav, navigate.wav)
Replaced icons (glyph, muxlaunch)
Replaced font

Tested at 640x480 resolution. Haven’t tested with other resolutions.
Shadows are not removed in themes with resolutions of 1024x768 and 1280x720.
